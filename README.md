Stay up to date with the news
As part of the course "Android Developer path" from Openclassrooms which i am currently still developing this app. İ am using Kotlin to develop the app.
İt's an application where you can read published news by NewYork Times within the app.  the New York Times has an API which allows you to get all the news they publish.
he application will have several tabs:
Top Stories.
Most Popular.
Business
 Magnifying class icon should be displayed, and when pressed, it allows you to search all articles in the New York Times database.
You can search for articles using the following criteria:
Keyword search (this field is required, meaning the user must fill it out).
The earliest possible publication date (optional search field, meaning the user does not need to fill this out).
The latest possible publication date (optional search field).
Category (at least one category must be selected).
Once validated, the results should be shown on a new screen as a list (like that of the home screen). If no result is found, İt lets the user know via popup alert.
Notifications will alert you when new articles are published depending on the criteria you'll have predefined. To do this, you'll add a notifications settings area that's accessible via the application home screen.
